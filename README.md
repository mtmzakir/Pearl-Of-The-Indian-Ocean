Indroduction
Create a website that displays Tourist information about Sri Lanka. This must contain all the 
well- known tourist places. It can be named “Pearl of the Indian Ocean” and it should contain 
an appropriate theme. Users could be able to browse Province/District wise information as 
well; it would be appreciated if you add other details like general information of SL and contact 
details of the service providers, etc.
The page should contain at least 5 distinct web pages, should have a captivating look, and be 
interactive. Some suggestions for pages are Home, about us, separate pages for tourist 
information, queries, To-Do List and Contact Us.
Guidelines:
1. You are free to decide on suitable pages, images, and their components as long as the 
basic requirements of the website are met.
2. Create a To-Do list using VueJs where users can enter their preferences (i.e: they can 
enter the list of the places where they planned to visit.), once they complete it, the list 
should display separately by the side of the same page.
3. Usages of Templates are prohibited. Make sure to avoid irrelevant 
components/information.
4. You are advised to use CSS, JavaScript, and VueJs framework to improve the look and 
feel of the website.
5. Backend functionality is NOT expected to be implemented.
6. E-commerce integration is NOT expected.
7. Marks will be distributed for the correct usage of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and VueJs

Description 
My webpage is for tourists who visits Sri Lanka. This webpage provides the best places in a 
particular Provinces in Sri Lanka. I have also included HTML, CSS, Java script and Vue Js to 
make this website. Clients can also note the places they wish to visit in the upcoming days. 
This can be done in a To-Do Section, and I have used Vue Js framework to do it. And I’m sure 
that I didn’t used any templates, etc. It’s my own creation.
I have added a video for the home background to make the website look realistic. I have added 
the images for the best places that are in a particular province I have also added videos in the 
end of each page to beautify web page. know more about those best places. I have also added 
a Query using Java script which can be useful for the tourists to ask any help and send feedback. 
About Us and Contact Us gives the information about the website and a way to contact them 
respectively.
Problems 
In case I was faced many problems. I have not learned about Vue Js at the time the mini project 
was given. It was hard to study Vue Js in that short time and complete the website. We have 
been given a Vue Js tutorial link in our LMS page, but it was hard to understand that tutorial 
because of lack of explanation. Since it is my first website it was hard to design the website.
Constraints
Minimum number of computers is at least 2 which will limit the development process if they 
are not available. Since Atom Code Editor provides rich web-based interactions, resolution of 
screen and graphics aspects of hardware are extremely important. Installations of Atom, 
Microsoft visual studio code are essentials which enable the developer to develop their 
application.
Solution Approach
I had a workshop at the final time in Vue Js. That workshop was so helpful to complete our 
mini project. So, I again watched the recorded video and I learned more.
W3Schools, YouTube, Google resources are very useful thing when I got problems. it’s a good
solution provider also.
I have looked through some of the YouTube videos on how to make a webpage. Those 
YouTube videos helped me complete this mini project.
I had an extra class by our tutor Sajitha Madam explaining Vue Js. Those explanations were 
also helped me using VueJs.
And finally, I was created To-Do list with VueJs Framework.

Conclusion
The purpose and objective of Pearl of the Indian Ocean project is achieved. By providing 
extremely rich graphical user interface, web page designing is easy and in an aesthetic form. 
Flexibility in designing makes user explore their imagination and thus, even a novice user can 
dream and accomplish their wish of web page designing
